## What is the problem?
Sometimes our contacts in Telegram add us to groups without our allowed, and after a while many groups are added unintentionally that often do not have interesting content, which is unpleasant.
Telegram does not have the possibility to disable the mandatory addition item completely. There are only `Everyone` and `My Contacts` options.

## What is the solution to this?
You can set the `Add to group` option to `My Contacts` and add all the contacts to the `Never Allow` exception list.

## Okey, What is the problem?
If the number of contacts is large, like me, more than 2 thousand! Doing this is difficult and time consuming.

## So what should be done?
This script will help you add all the contacts to the `Never Allow` exception list easily and quickly.

## How to do it?
- Open the web version of Telegram in Google Chrome: [https://web.telegram.org/z](https://web.telegram.org/z)
- Follow this path: `Settings > Privacy and Security > Who can add me to group chats?`
- While you have ticked the `My Contacts` option. Tap on `Never Allow`.
- Press the <kbd>CTRL+SHIFT+I</kbd> buttons at the same time.
- Select the `Console` tab.
- Copy and paste the project [script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NabiKAZ/selects-all-telegram-contacts/main/selects-all-telegram-contacts.js) and hit enter.

The result should look like the video below:
